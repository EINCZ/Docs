# EINCZ Security Artifacts

This folder contains the public security, roles and governance configuration 
documents related to the EINCZ protocol. 

It includes role assignment reports, timelock governance settings, smart-contract 
references, and audit-ready artifacts used for transparency and verification.

The primary file in this folder is `roles_configuration.json`, which must be 
updated after each governance action or on-chain role modification.
